# How the project works
### Clock.js
  The first functon in clock.js "functon OnResize" is resizing and the look of each object. 
  The second function "function format2" is a Conditional Operator(ternary operator) of "i" which is a value being passed into the function, and is the min on the clock
  The third function "formatTime" is just trying to figures out is am or pm, make the " : " apppear and disappear, and how would the hour min display.
  The fourth function "OnTimer" is to diaplay the time, am or pm, the date, and the day of the week and the alarm, and also the time zone 
  The fifth function init is whenu click the button it will bring u to the options setting page. 1000ms = 1 second and maake sure the clock will tick, and the day of the week
